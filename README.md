# Passive Suggestion Board

Welcome to the world of passive aggression. Mr. Resetti says to sign in. Leave passive-aggressive messages in a public forum. Write passive-aggressive messages about coworkers, classmates, bosses, mothers-in-law, stray dogs, you name it.

To use the app, just sign in and from there you can view suggestions, write suggestions, and even leave a comment under suggestions. If you are not a guest then sadly you can only look at them. No touch.

## Attributions

I grabbed this code for some of my buttons and links in different ways.
- [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/css-floating-animation/)
<br>
I refactored the code from this site and made the screensaver feature out of it.
- [animal crossing gif](https://tenor.com/view/passive-agressive-anger-gif-20076223)
<br>
I used this little passive-aggressive animal crossing character to set the mood.
- [wifflegif. com](https://wifflegif.com/gifs/706088-animal-crossing-video-game-gif)

## Next Steps


- Add a range in place of the passive or not input so that suggestions have a numerical value that dictates how passive or aggressive they are.
- Rank suggestions by how passive or aggressive they are
- Instead of a screensaver, a game of snake should begin after 15 seconds of idoling
- The user will be able to play a full game of Snake if they are bored.
